# ECS170FacialRecognition
Wrote a program that reads in a set of images and learns to distinguish between male/female faces. The input nodes was the number of pixels in the picture, and three were two output nodes to represent male or female. Used hidden nodes and layers to simplify the neural network and prevent overfitting. Initially randomized weights throughout the neural network.  Used backpropagation to update the weights in our neural network to minimize the error for each output neuron. Calculated the error for each cycle of the neural network as the AI learned from training images. Was tested with a set of images (not androgynous people) for grading.  Used a confidence estimate to determine the accuracy of our AIâ€™s predictions.
